## Difference between student Profile and Student Diary

A student profile only provides details about name, address, contact 
number, father, local gaurdian etc. It is a static information which 
don't give any details about the student.

Student Diary keeps track of all activities (both academic and 
extracuricular activities) of a student from the date of joining till 
he/she finishes his/her course.For example,

* Participation in a Tech Fest
* Winning prizes in events
* Cultural event participation
* Malpractise during exam
* Other wrong remarks etc
* Placement Details
* History of CGPA and arrears.

## Stages

 **Stage 1**

 List down the classes which you require to develope the software based 
 on your own ideas. (Don't consult other people for ideas).

 Write skelton (if possible working) code for all the classes with a 
 main 
 class (which has public static void main(String[] args)) method known 
 as 
 "StudentDiary.java". The number of classes should not be less than 100. 
 If so, your code is outrightly rejected.

 This will be the class invoked using command $ java Student Diary

 No login, password protection is required. It takes away your time. 
 Upload (check in/ commit) your code in SVN. Deliverable: You need to 
 submit softcopy and hardcopy of the classes and their functions along 
 with an overall write-up about the software you are going to build.

 **Stage 2**

 Check out the code from SVN, refactor( restructure/rename/modify) your 
 code (classes and methods) using the principle of inheritance and 
 polymorphism. Use bottom up approach. That is group all similar classes 
 and think whether they can have a super class. Sometime, the super 
 class 
 may be an abstract class. There are plenty of opportunities in the 
 software for inheritance, polymorphism and abstract classes. Commit 
 your 
 code (version 2) in SVN (SVN will take care of verision) Deliverable: 
 Nothing.

 **Stage 3**

 Checkout the code, now think of applying Interfaces and group your 
 classes into meaning full packages. (The standard way of naming is 
 "org.amrita.u4cseXXX.project".

 Commit your code (Version 3) in SVN. Deliverable: Modified version of 
 first deliverable (both hardcopy and softcopy).

 **Stage 4**

 Checkout your code. It requires lot of modification because now you 
 know 
 more about data structures and genrics in Java. Modify your code to 
 organize your data in a more understandable way.

 Commit your code (Version 4) in SVN. Deliverable: List of data 
 structures and the purpose of using them in a tabular fashion. (hard 
 and 
 soft copy).

 **Stage 5**

 Checkout your code. Modify your interface from standard terminal to GUI 
 using Applet or Swing. Though we cover applets towards the end of 
 semester, we will provide documentation in the web site which will be 
 self readable.

 Commit your code (Version 5) (last one) in SVN.

 Deliverable: 1. Zipped source code 2. Brief write-up about your project 
 experience. [Mention date for all deliverables]

 ## How to develop software.

 It is not possible to finish the code only during lab session. Lab 
 session should be used for commiting/checkout modifications, 
 discussions 
 with faculty and some coding. You are expected to put more effort other 
 than lab hours in order to meet the deadline.

 ## User Input and Persistance

 Upto version 4, the user interface is terminal. Only during version 5, 
 you build a GUI using Java Applets/Swing classes.
 Data should be persistant. It can stored in a file which can be updated 
 from time to time. The format may be a plain text file, data file or an 
 object file.
 ## SVN Submission

 You are provided with an SVN account in Saktimayi with your Amritavidya 
 credentials. You can access Saktimayi only through AmritaConnect 
 (either 
 from lab or from hostel). No Github.

 Saktimayi SVN documentation will be available in the website.

 ## Devlierable Submission

 There will be link in AUMS for soft copy and hard copy should be 
 submitted to your faculty. (No pen and paper). Only neatly typed copies 
 are accepted.
